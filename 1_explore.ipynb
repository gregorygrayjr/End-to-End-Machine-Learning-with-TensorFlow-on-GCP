# <h2> Explore data </h2>
# 
# The data is natality data (record of births in the US). My goal is to predict the baby's weight given a number of factors about the pregnancy and the baby's mother.  Later, we will want to split the data into training and eval datasets. The hash of the year-month will be used for that -- this way, twins born on the same day won't end up in different cuts of the data.

# Create SQL query using natality data after the year 2000

SELECT
  weight_pounds,
  is_male,
  mother_age,
  plurality,
  gestation_weeks,
  ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT(CONCAT(CAST(YEAR AS STRING), CAST(month AS STRING)))) AS hashmonth
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE year > 2000

# Let's write a query to find the unique values for each of the columns and the count of those values.

# All these factors seem to play a part in the baby's weight. Male babies are heavier on average than female babies. Teenaged and older moms tend to have lower-weight babies. Twins, triplets, etc. are lower weight than single births. Preemies weigh in lower as do babies born to single moms. In addition, it is important to check whether you have enough data (number of babies) for each input value. Otherwise, the model prediction against input values that doesn't have enough data may not be reliable.
# <p>
# In the next notebook, I will develop a machine learning model to combine all of these factors to come up with a prediction of a baby's weight.
